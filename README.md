# Personal Portfolio (Free Code Camp)
This a project from Free Code Camp to receive the Responsive Web Design Certification. The goal is to create a personal portfolio

I created a simple portfolio that adopts the layout from Free Code Camp model. It is not intended to be my real portfolio.

Here it is the model: https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/

Here it is my version: https://italo617.github.io/personal-portfolio-fcc/
